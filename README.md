# MaskDetection
A CNN model that uses TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, and Scikit-learn to detect whether individuals in a picture are properly wearing masks

To run the model on any given image, change the EXAMPLE_PATH variable in the mask_detection.py file based on the path to the image and run mask_detection.py.
